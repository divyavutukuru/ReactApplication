->webpack configuration:
    1.devtool:'inline-source-map' - is used for giving line numbers
    2.entry : - it is the place where the webpack is going to look for files
    output - it is where we can find what to output.we give the file name here which is the standard
    resolve :{moduleDirectories:['node_modules','src']} - it is the place where webpack looks what files need to be bundled.
    module: {loaders} - this is where webpack is going to define loaders .loaders are nothing but the modules that we use for react to load
    plugins: we usually use webpack.NoErrorsPlugin - which does not allow webpack to compile if there are any errors
